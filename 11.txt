✔ Email Notification on Build Success / Failure

(Using Gmail App Password Method – Works 100%)

🎯 PART–1: Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Webhook

Goal: Whenever you push code to GitHub → Jenkins should auto-build.

STEP 1 — Start Jenkins & Expose it Publicly using ngrok
1. Start ngrok on Jenkins port

If Jenkins runs on 8080, in CMD run:
ngrok config add-authtoken 36GfR6iFnGz9FLkKvHRYxlztQsQ_62ZEBwmMEKG7ccmtR6tZR
ngrok http 8080


You will get a URL like:

https://abc123.ngrok-free.app

2. Copy the “Forwarding URL”

Example (from your file)

https://corkier-darla-handsome.ngrok-free.dev


You will use this inside GitHub Webhooks.

STEP 2 — Create a Jenkins Job for Webhook
1. In Jenkins → Click New Item

Give name:

CI_Webhook_Job


Choose → Freestyle Project

2. Configure Source Code Management

Go to Source Code Management → Git

Enter your GitHub repo URL (HTTPS):

https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo.git


Branch:

main

3. Add Build Step (Maven Project)

If using Maven:

clean install

4. Enable Webhook trigger

Go to Build Triggers
✔ Check:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling


Click Apply → Save

STEP 3 — Create GitHub Webhook
1. Open your GitHub repository

Go → Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

2. Fill the form:
Payload URL

Forwarding URL from ngrok + /github-webhook/

Example:

https://corkier-darla-handsome.ngrok-free.dev/github-webhook/

Content type:
application/json

Events:

Choose:

Just the push event


Click Add webhook

Webhook will show:

✔ Green tick – Means working
❌ Red cross – Means Jenkins unreachable

STEP 4 — Test CI Automation

Go to your repo

Edit ANY file

Click Commit Changes

✔ Jenkins → Automatically starts building
✔ Dashboard will show:

Started by GitHub push


Congrats! 🎉
You've successfully implemented CI using Webhooks.

🎯 PART–2: Email Notification on Build Success / Failure

This uses Gmail App Password because Gmail blocks direct SMTP.

STEP 1 — Create Gmail App Password
1. Open Google Account

Go → Security

2. Turn ON:

✔ 2-Step Verification

3. Go to:

Google Account → Security → App Passwords

Select:

App: Other
Name: Jenkins


→ Click Generate

You will get a 16-digit password like:

abcd efgh ijkl mnop


COPY IT — this is used in Jenkins SMTP.

STEP 2 — Install Email Extension Plugin

In Jenkins:

Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available

Install:

Email Extension Plugin


Restart Jenkins if required.

STEP 3 — Configure Global Email (SMTP)

Go:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System

Scroll to:

A. Email Notification (Simple Mailer)

Fill:

Field	Value
SMTP Server	smtp.gmail.com
Use SMTP auth	✔
Username	your Gmail ID
Password	16-digit App Password
SSL	✔
SMTP Port	465

Click:

Test configuration by sending a test email


If you receive the email → ✔ SMTP working

B. Extended Email Notification

Fill:

Field	Value
SMTP Server	smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port	465
SSL	✔
Credentials	Add Gmail + App Password
Default Content Type	text/html

Save settings.

STEP 4 — Configure Email for your Jenkins Job

Open your CI job:

Project → Configure → Post-Build Actions → Add post-build action

Select:

Editable Email Notification

Fill:

Project Recipient List:

yourmail@gmail.com


Triggers to enable:
✔ Failure
✔ Success
✔ Always (optional)

Subject (optional):

Build Status: $BUILD_STATUS


Body: (optional)

Job: ${JOB_NAME}
Status: ${BUILD_STATUS}
URL: ${BUILD_URL}


Save.

STEP 5 — Test Email Notification

Make code changes that cause a build success

Make code changes that cause a build failure (optional):

Example: remove semicolon in Java file

You will receive:

📩 SUCCESS EMAIL
📩 FAILURE EMAIL

🎉 CI/CD Successfully Implemented!

You now have:

✔ GitHub → Jenkins CI using Webhooks
✔ Automatic Build Trigger
✔ Email Alerts (Success + Failure)
✔ Fully working from your lab manual 

SE_Record_final

 — rewritten in a usable format
If you want, I can also create:

✅ A pipeline script (Jenkinsfile)
✅ A full CI/CD diagram
✅ A video tutorial link (working, not blocked)
Just tell me!
