Exploring git local and remote commands on the multi-folder project:

cd ~/Documents

✔ STEP 2 — Clone the repo

Example (replace with your repo URL):

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/your-repo.git


Example with your repo:

git clone https://github.com/pranithaavula4-tech/node_crash_course.git


Or if you're practicing with Brad’s repo:

git clone https://github.com/bradtraversy/node_crash_course.git

✔ STEP 3 — Enter the project folder
cd node_crash_course



```bash
# confirm current branch & status
git branch
git status

# see configured remote(s)
git remote -v

# list recent commits (short)
git log --oneline -n 10
```

If your remote needs to be your own repo (not someone else’s), set it:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
```

If GitHub asks for credentials on push, use your **username** and a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** as password.

## 1) `rejected - non-fast-forward` (someone changed remote first)

**Goal:** Bring remote changes into your work, then push.

Steps:

```bash
# make sure you committed your local work first
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: save before rebasing"   # only if you have changes to commit

# fetch + rebase your local commits on top of remote
git pull --rebase origin main

# If conflicts appear: resolve files, then
git add <resolved-file>   # after resolving conflicts
git rebase --continue     # continue the rebase until finished

# finally push
git push origin main
```

If you prefer not to rebase, you can `git pull --no-rebase` (merge), but rebase keeps history linear.

---

## 2) Push a feature branch **without** touching `main`

**Goal:** Create and push a separate branch.

Steps:

```bash
# create & switch to branch
git checkout -b feature/homepage-ui

# make changes, then
git add .
git commit -m "Add homepage UI"

# push this branch (creates remote branch)
git push -u origin feature/homepage-ui
```

`-u` sets upstream so future `git push` works without specifying origin/branch.

---

## 3) Remote added new branches — fetch them locally

**Goal:** Get latest remote refs and checkout new branch.

Steps:

```bash
# update remote info
git fetch origin

# list remote branches
git branch -r

# create a local branch tracking the remote branch (example: remote branch 'frontend')
git checkout -b frontend origin/frontend

# OR simply
git checkout frontend   # works if your Git version auto-creates tracking branch
```

`git fetch` updates your local view of remote branches but doesn’t change your current branch.

---

## 4) Bring teammate changes while avoiding conflicts (stash + rebase)

**Goal:** Temporarily store your uncommitted work, update, then reapply.

Steps:

```bash
# stash local uncommitted changes
git stash

# bring remote changes and rebase them onto your branch
git pull --rebase origin main

# reapply your stashed changes
git stash pop

# if conflicts after stash pop: resolve files, git add, git commit
```

If you had committed changes already, you do not need stash — just rebase.

---

## 5) Remove a sensitive file you accidentally pushed (lab-level)

**Goal:** Stop tracking the file going forward (lab-level; history not rewritten).

Steps (simple/lab):

```bash
# remove from Git index but keep locally
git rm --cached path/to/secret.txt

# add .gitignore entry to prevent re-adding
echo "path/to/secret.txt" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore

git commit -m "Remove sensitive file from repo and add to .gitignore"
git push origin main
```

**Note:** This does not remove the file from git history. For full removal from history use BFG or `git filter-branch` and then **rotate** the leaked secret.

---

## 6) Integrate latest `main` into your feature branch (rebase recommended)

**Goal:** Make your feature branch up-to-date with `main`.

Steps:

```bash
# switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature/homepage-ui

# fetch remote updates
git fetch origin

# rebase your feature branch onto the latest main
git rebase origin/main

# resolve conflicts if any (git add ... && git rebase --continue)
# then push (force push required if branch already on remote)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/homepage-ui
```

Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` — safer because it checks remote hasn’t moved unexpectedly.

---

## 7) Push changes to a *different* remote repository

**Goal:** Replace remote URL or add a new remote.

Steps (replace origin):

```bash
# option A: replace origin with new repo
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/new-repo.git
git push -u origin main

# OR option B: add a second remote (keeps original)
git remote add myfork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/new-repo.git
git push -u myfork main
```

---

## 8) Local branch behind remote, but you have uncommitted changes

**Goal:** Save uncommitted work, update, restore work.

Steps:

```bash
git stash                      # stash local edits
git pull --rebase origin main  # update local branch
git stash pop                  # reapply your edits
# resolve any conflicts, then add & commit
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts after update"
```

If you have committed local changes, you can rebase those instead of using stash.

---

## 9) Resolve merge conflicts after `git pull`

**Goal:** Fix conflict markers and complete merge/rebase.

When you see conflict markers in files:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

Steps:

1. Open each conflicted file in an editor, decide what to keep or combine.
2. Remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers and make the final content correct.
3. Then:

```bash
git add path/to/resolved-file
# If you were merging:
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
# If you were rebasing:
git rebase --continue
# Finally push
git push origin main
```

Tip: `git status` shows conflicted files. `git diff` helps inspect changes.

---

## 10) Delete a branch from the remote

**Goal:** Remove remote branch after it’s no longer needed.

Steps:

```bash
# delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/homepage-ui

# optionally delete local branch too
git branch -d feature/homepage-ui   # fails if not merged
git branch -D feature/homepage-ui   # force delete
```

---

## Extra useful commands & tips

* See branches (local & remote):

```bash
git branch        # local
git branch -r     # remote
git branch -a     # all
```

* Show remote URL:

```bash
git remote -v
```

* If a push asks for credentials and fails, clear credentials (Windows Credential Manager) or configure credential helper:

```bash
# to cache credentials locally for some time
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

* When rewriting history (force pushes), prefer `--force-with-lease` to avoid accidentally overwriting others’ work.

## Quick example workflow (safe typical flow)

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# create branch and work
git checkout -b feature-x
# edit files...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement X"

# make sure feature branch is up-to-date
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin feature-x

=>
git pull --rebase origin <branch-name>
git push origin feature/feat-1
git fetch origin
git checkout branch-name
git stash                   
git pull --rebase origin main
git stash pop               
git rm --cached path/to/file
git commit -m "Remove sensitive file"
git push origin main
    git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
    "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file" \
    --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
git checkout feature/your-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push origin branch-name
git stash
git pull --rebase origin branch-name
git stash pop
git pull origin branch-name
git add .
git commit
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name
